            <b>Ethiopian</b><br>
            Coffees from Ethiopia are always a favorite. For many years, they have been the world's<br>
            best-reviewed single-origin premium coffee beans. As the fifth largest coffee producer in<br>
            the world, Ethiopia has mastered the art of harvesting and processing the beans, and the<br>
            flavor profiles are perfectly complex and delicious.

            <b>Brazilian</b><br>
            When you think about rich, fragrant, and delicious coffee, does Brazil come to mind?<br>
            It should because Brazil is the second-largest consumer of coffee in the world. Brazil is<br>
            a beautiful, tropical country filled with rainforest, and its warm climate makes it very ideal<br>
            for growing coffee. Currently, Brazil produces about one-third of the world’s coffee supply

            <b>Colombian</b><br>
            Colombia is famous for growing some of the best coffee beans in the world; the plants thrive<br>
            under the shade of banana trees in the tropical climate. Because of Colombia’s high altitude,<br>
            it also shapes the way the bean grows.
